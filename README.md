# Detect and Map Fractures in a Medium for CO2 Sequestration and Storage
### Using the Amplitudes of Reflected Acoustic Waves

#### Evaluating the potential for CO2 Sequestration in Subsurface Reservoirs.

TLDR: When acoustic waves reflect off a medium with vertically aligned fractures - the amplitude of the reflected waves will vary with direction.  This study detects, measures and maps the change in amplitude with direction and inferes the presence and intensity of fractures.
